## üß† Folder Overview

- **`/cmd/monitor`**: Application entry point that initializes and starts the packet analysis service.
- **`/internal/application`**: Application service layer containing business logic and use cases for packet analysis.
- **`/internal/domain/model`**: Domain entities and value objects including packet data structures and capture configurations.
- **`/internal/infrastructure/capture`**: Infrastructure layer with packet capture implementation using gopacket library.
- **`/internal/config`**: Configuration management for loading and handling application settings.
- **`/pkg/logger`**: Colored logging system with multiple log levels (Info, Success, Warning, Error, Process, System).
- **`/pkg/utils`**: Shared utility functions for network operations like local IP detection.
- **`/config`**: Configuration files (YAML) for application parameters and settings.
- **`/vendor`**: Vendored dependencies managed by Go modules.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time packet capture** on multiple network interfaces
- **Clean architecture** following Domain-Driven Design principles
- **Colored logging** with multiple severity levels
- **Local traffic filtering** to monitor only outgoing packets
- **Protocol analysis** for TCP, UDP, and other network protocols
- **Cross-platform support** with proper Windows network capture support

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Go 1.21.5 or higher
- Network capture library (Npcap for Windows, libpcap for Unix-like systems)
- Administrator/root privileges for packet capture

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Install Npcap** (Windows) or ensure libpcap is available (Linux/macOS)
   - Windows: Download from [https://nmap.org/npcap/](https://nmap.org/npcap/)

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Julia-Marcal/packet-scope.git
   cd packet-scope
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

4. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   go build -o packet-scope ./cmd/monitor
   ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage

Run the packet monitor with administrator privileges:

```bash
# Windows (run as Administrator)
.\packet-scope.exe

# Linux/macOS (run with sudo)
sudo ./packet-scope
```

The application will:
- Detect all available network interfaces
- Start capturing packets on each interface
- Filter and display only outgoing traffic from your machine
- Show packet information including IP addresses, protocols, and ports

## üìä Example Output

```
[15:04:05] [INFO] Starting packet capture on 3 interfaces with local IP: 192.168.1.100
[eth0] 15:04:05 | Len=54 | IP 192.168.1.100 -> 8.8.8.8 | TCP 45678 -> 53
[wlan0] 15:04:06 | Len=42 | IP 192.168.1.100 -> 192.168.1.1 | UDP 68 -> 67
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Windows: `panic: couldn't load wpcap.dll`

To capture network packets on Windows, you need Npcap (recommended) or WinPcap (obsolete).

**Solution:**
1. Download and install Npcap: [https://nmap.org/npcap/](https://nmap.org/npcap/)
2. During installation, make sure to check "Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible mode"
3. Restart your computer after installation
4. Run the application as Administrator

### Linux/macOS: Permission Denied

If you get permission errors when trying to capture packets:

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run with sudo
sudo ./packet-scope

# Or give the binary packet capture capabilities (Linux only)
sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip ./packet-scope
```

### No Interfaces Found

If the application reports "no network interfaces found":

**Solutions:**
- Ensure you're running with administrator/root privileges
- Check that your network capture library is properly installed
- Verify that network interfaces are active and available

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project follows Clean Architecture principles:

- **Domain Layer** (`internal/domain`): Contains business entities and rules
- **Application Layer** (`internal/application`): Contains use cases and application services  
- **Infrastructure Layer** (`internal/infrastructure`): Contains external implementations
- **Interface Layer** (`pkg/logger`, `cmd`): Contains external interfaces and entry points
